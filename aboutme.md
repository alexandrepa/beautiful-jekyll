## Presentation
My name is Alexandre Patelli. I am a French Software Engineering student at the UTT in Troyes.  
I'm a huge fan of computer development in general and particularly in ES6 and nodeJS.  
You can find my other projects on my [Github](https://github.com/alexandrepa).  
I'm also a big fan of sports and football, supporting the fantastic club of Olympique de Marseille :).  

## The API
I wanted to do my first serious project in nodeJS. So I chose to develop this API because I didn't find any free football API which provides historical results and fixtures.

## Future and improvements
I'm still a young developper so it's very possible that you find bug in this API.  
So please feel free to send me an [email](mailto://alexandre.patelli@utt.fr) if you find bugs or if you have some suggestions for the next version.
